My Personal Gentoo Overlay
==========================

What is this?
-------------
It's a Gentoo_ overlay_. It's a set of "ebuilds" that describe how to install
software â€” how to build it, what the dependencies are, etc. The "overlay" bit
means it is in addition to what comes with Gentoo. This git repository holds
ebuilds for stuff I use, but Gentoo's main repositories lack, mostly because
these packages are too obscure.
